    feedback: `Iâ€™m currently pursuing the Python Full Stack Developer course at IT VEDANT, and Iâ€™ve had such a great experience so far. The mentors explain concepts clearly and are responsive when we have questions, which really supports the learning process. Nitin Sirâ€™s teaching style is calm and beginner-friendly, which makes it easy for me to grasp concepts without feeling overwhelmed. A special thanks to Aman Sir as well, whoâ€™s always on point with updates and support for our batch.

The course is very practical, filled with real-world projects and industry-relevant content. What impresses me the most is how they also focus on the non-technical sideâ€”sessions on communication, resume building, LinkedIn/GitHub profiles, presentation skills, and interview preparation really set you up for success.

Additionally, the student portal provides structured learning resources, detailed notes, and a personalized progress report that helps track our development throughout the course.

Honestly, joining Itvedant has been one of the smartest moves Iâ€™ve made for my career, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning and growing here.`,
